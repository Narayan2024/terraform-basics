# terraform-basics

In this repository, we are going to place all the needed bascis that are needed to kick start our Terraform Provisioning Capabilites.

Most of the information in terraform should be referred from terraform registry only :

In this training, we would be using the latest version of terraform v1.5.2 ( 10/July/2023 )

Terraform supports more 3,339 cloud providers and this keep on growing and this is the major reason why manority of the companies prefer to create infrastucture using terraform.

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. Infrastructure as code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through the use of code. This code is typically written in a declarative language, which means that you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, rather than the steps that need to be taken to create it.

Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure resources. HCL is a human-readable language that makes it easy to write infrastructure code. Terraform also keeps track of your real infrastructure in a state file, which acts as a source of truth for your environment. Terraform uses the state file to determine the changes to make to your infrastructure so that it will match your configuration.

Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure on a variety of cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It can also be used to manage infrastructure on-premises.

There are many benefits to using Terraform, including:

Reproducibility: Terraform code can be versioned and stored in a source control system, making it easy to reproduce your infrastructure.
Consistency: Terraform can be used to create infrastructure that is consistent across different environments.
Reusability: Terraform modules can be reused to create infrastructure that is shared across different projects.
Auditability: Terraform state files can be used to track changes to your infrastructure, making it easier to audit your environment.

Overall, Terraform is a powerful tool that can be used to manage infrastructure in a safe, predictable, and repeatable way.

Here are some of the specific reasons why Terraform is used:

To provision and manage cloud infrastructure.
To automate the creation and deployment of applications.
To improve the consistency and reliability of infrastructure.
To track changes to infrastructure and ensure compliance.
To share infrastructure code with other teams.

If you are looking for a way to manage your infrastructure in a more efficient and reliable way, then Terraform is a great option.
